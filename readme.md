This is my logic of how to make a weather app based on CLI:

1. Ask the user for an input city.
2. Understand using natural language what that city is.
3. Enter that into the API and fetch the corresponding weather data.
4. Display it to the user.

I feel like this is the high-level logic but I might be missing something.
